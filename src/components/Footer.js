Through the use of AI and Machine Learning, our application will be able to suggest new movie titles similar to movies or genres that the user has previously liked or selected, thus allowing it to present the user with screen times at their local movie theater. In order to complete this project, our team will be using Agile methodology with Scrum framework, along with G-Suite, Zoom, and Whatâ€™s App for communication.";
