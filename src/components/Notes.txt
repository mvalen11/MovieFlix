This is just for to keep in track of what the heck is going on

//movieflix-63f29.web.app

So first things first, 
Congrats on the progress so far. 

Now we need 
 ->   Authentication
 ->   Profile Selection
 ->   Sign/Sign Up pages 
But all in the style of Disney.com

We also need 
 ->   Footer
 ->   About us page
To conclude the project. 

I want an about us page because it'll be beneficial for us in the long run. We can use this 
and put this in a resume. So future employers have access to this and see our work. 

I smell victory...

Small notes..
-> Make the header buttons work
    -> Start Watching 
    -> Settings
-> Maybe even add Lucifer's pic on the popup?
